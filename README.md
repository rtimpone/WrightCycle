# WrightCycle

This is an iOS app I've been working on for use with Chicago's Divvy bike sharing program. The app allows users to see bike stations on a map, favorite certain stations, and view their Divvy account activity in a web view. It's designed to be a simple, streamlined experience that does a few things well compared to other more complex, feature-heavy Divvy apps currently available. The public Divvy API that the app gets its data from can be found at http://www.divvybikes.com/stations/json. 

The app is in the early stages of development so it will be changing a lot. Stay tuned for more details. Also the name will change eventually - Wright Cycle is just a placeholder.
